Project done in CMPT135 from SFU Concurrent studies. Header file and converse function was done by my instructor at the time as part of the project.
This is a school project from my time at SFU concurrent studies that I would like to showcase. It is a demonstration of what I have learned. 
I specify the header files and functions that the instructor put in as part of the project. 

NOTE: This program was developed in a Linux VM Environment. For some reason it may not work as intended. This happened when I tried to test this program recently. If it behaves in a weird way (i.e. a logic error), it may be due to a change in the technical environment.
